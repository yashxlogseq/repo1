title: Future and Options
---
## **This is something that is applicable in India ONLY. **
### Hence, this is not very applicable, but it is useful none - the less.
## The difference between future and options is that while futures are linear, options are not linear. Derivatives mean that they do not have any value of their own but their value is derived from an underlying asset. 
## A Future is a right and an obligation to buy or sell an underlying stock (or other assets) at a predetermined price and deliverable at a predetermined time.

## Options and Futures are traded in contracts of 1 month, 2 months and 3 months. All F&O contracts will expire on the last Thursday of the month. Futures will trade at a Futures price which is normally at a premium to the spot price due to the time value. There will only be one Futures price for a stock for one contract.
## Futures offer the advantage of trading equities with a margin. But the risks are unlimited on the opposite side irrespective of whether you are long or short on the futures
