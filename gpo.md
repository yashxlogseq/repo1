## **Aim: **Help businesses interested in buying similar products gain leverage through combined purchasing power.
## There are three types of GPO's
### Vertical market
#### A vertical market GPO is focused on one industry or vertical. For example, in the healthcare market, there are small- and mid-sized medical centers or hospitals that join forces to reduce their costs.
### Horizontal market
#### Horizontal market GPO members exist in many different industries, but they purchase a lot of the same goods and services to build their products and run their companies. OMNIA Partners is an example of a horizontal market GPO.
### Master buyer
#### This is when one chief buying organization has substantial contracts in place with vendors and allows additional companies to buy off those contracts. The automotive industry is a perfect real-world example of the master buyer model because Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers can access the pricing contracts large automotive manufacturers have negotiated with vendors.
