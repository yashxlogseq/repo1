## [[Financial management and MedTech]]
### Standardisation of procurement, managing costs to streamline hospital operations and encourage collaboration opportunities.
### "Overall, the trend toward cost management and streamlined hospital operations is likely to be more pronounced in the future as hospitals continue to pursue multiple cost-management strategies, such as experimentation with volume-based centralized procurement, greater participation in GPO s and greater outsourcing of select services."

### "As part of the program, healthcare authorities will start to carry out pooled procurement of drugs based on the volume required at public medical institutions in certain regions."
### "It could be seen as a “winner takes it (almost) all” approach: The single bidder offering the lowest price for a molecule will be guaranteed a volume equaling about 70 percent of the 2017-procurement volume for the eleven cities."
### It can be seen as an #EOS process, where you race to the bottom.
#### Not perticularly #EOS , but rather #EOA
### "Chinese officials expect a substantial drop of overall drug prices for those that win the bidding. For the first wave of molecules that were selected for the pilot program, the overall price dropped 52 percent with the highest drop at 96 percent. Established products and generics will face the risk of price reduction in particular."
## [[Off-patent Drugs]]
### The drug which is a copy of branded drug and is equivalent in terms of safety, efficacy, dosage and use is called a generic drug or off-patent drug
### "There is a strong possibility of price erosion with negative effects for off-patent originators - that accounted for about 18 per cent of the Chinese market in 2017 - who will now face stronger competition from generics."
## [[Digitalising patient care]]
### "Improvement in patient access to healthcare through alternative sites of care or telemedicine"

### The eventual goal is to come out of the traditional hospital setting
