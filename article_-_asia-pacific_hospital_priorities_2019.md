## The lack of Financial Management
### This is an idea that has come up a lot of times.
### "Rising emphasis on cost management and streamlining of hospital operations across APAC"
### The lack of financial management makes it imperative to streamline the procurement process.
## The 4+7 cities pilot scheme
### Representing 30% of the drug market in China
### A step for "Healthy China 2030"
### "As part of the program, healthcare authorities will start to carry out pooled procurement of drugs based on the volume required at public medical institutions in certain regions."
### "It could be seen as a “winner takes it (almost) all” approach: The single bidder offering the lowest price for a molecule will be guaranteed a volume equaling about 70 percent of the 2017-procurement volume for the eleven cities."
### It can be seen as an EOS process, where you race to the bottom.
### "Chinese officials expect a substantial drop of overall drug prices for those that win the bidding. For the first wave of molecules that were selected for the pilot program, the overall price dropped 52 percent with the highest drop at 96 percent. Established products and generics will face the risk of price reduction in particular."
### "There is a strong possibility of price erosion with negative effects for off-patent originators - that accounted for about 18 per cent of the Chinese market in 2017 - who will now face stronger competition from generics."
#### The drug which is a copy of branded drug and is equivalent in terms of safety, efficacy, dosage and use is called a generic drug or **off patent drug**
## Digitalising patient care
### "Improvement in patient access to healthcare through alternative sites of care or telemedicine"
