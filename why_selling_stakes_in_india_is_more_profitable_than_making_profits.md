title: Why selling stakes in India is more profitable than making profits 
---
## The system in India is:
### 20% tax on profits
### Some more divident tax
### Tax on divident
## So, by the time you actually start making profit, 55% of your profit goes to the government.
## By selling stakes, a VC will invest in the company. You pay in short term or long term capital gains (15 - 20%)
## **"The tax incentive is structured for promoters to sell stake and make money then actually make profit and make money."**
